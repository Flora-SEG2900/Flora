            Flora was founded by five software engineering students in SEG 2900 course. It was called Flora, 
            after the Roman goddess of flowers and of the season of spring. She was a symbol of nature and flowers. 
            We came up with this idea as we saw the need for more trees and stewardship toward nature especially with current world events where many humans were are not aware of the seriousness of climate change. This app motivates and encourages humans to take a more holistic look at nature while also enjoying the art of gardening. Through this experience as a team, 
            we learned many key engineering principles that would help us all in the workplace such as the importance of teamwork, design, 
            and project management.
