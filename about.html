    <h3>OUR FOUNDING</h3>

            Flora was founded by five software engineering students in SEG 2900 course. It was called Flora, 
            after the Roman goddess of flowers and of the season of spring. She was a symbol of nature and flowers. 
            We came up with this idea as we saw the need for more trees and stewardship toward nature especially with current world events where many humans were are not aware of the seriousness of climate change. This app motivates and encourages humans to take a more holistic look at nature while also enjoying the art of gardening. Through this experience as a team, 
            we learned many key engineering principles that would help us all in the workplace such as the importance of teamwork, design, 
            and project management.

            When FLORA was first founded, our goal was originally to encourage everyone to get outdoors and appreciate mother nature 
            but  from feedback from thousands of satisfied cusotmers we have realized they have found gardening as a passion. 
            That is why at FLORA we beleive that once sown gardening is an art that never dies and through our app and our device we
            want to bring millions of people all of over the world the beauty of nature. Customers have also been rewarded for doing 
            what they love. We want to thank our sponsors and partners in helping saving the Earth one plant at a time.
